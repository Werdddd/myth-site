              parents to let light into the world. This act created the heavens and the earth and allowed the gods to
              rule over different realms. The myth reflects Māori beliefs about nature, family, and the sacred origins

          <h2 class="mb-4">Korean Creation Myth</h2>
          <p>In the beginning, when the heavens and the earth were formed, Maitreya (Miruk) too came into being.
            Maitreya decided to separate the heavens and the earth because they were joined together. So Maitreya placed
            the heavens like the handle of the lid of a kettle and set pillars at the four corners of the earth.<br><br>
            There were two suns and two moons in those times. Maitreya created the Big Dipper and the Archer from the
            torn pieces of one moon, and created the big stars and the little stars from the torn pieces of one sun.
            Maitreya ordered that the big stars take charge of the fate of the kings and their vassals, and the little
            stars take charge of the destiny of the people.<br><br>
            There was no cloth when Maitreya wanted to make clothes. So Maitreya plucked the vines of arrowroot which
            stretched from mountain to mountain, peeled their bark, boiled them and twisted them into thread. Then
            Maitreya wove a Buddhist monk's robe by moving the shuttle up and down after he had laid a loom beneath the
            sky, and tied his warp to the clouds. The body of the jacket took a whole roll of cloth, the sleeve was a
            half roll of cloth, the outer collar took five feet, and the collar neck took three feet. Next, Maitreya
            sheared one foot and three inches of hemp to make a hat, but the hat did not fully cover his eyes. Maitreya
            again snipped two feet and three inches of hemp to manufacture the hat, as the hat also did not veil his
            ears. Last, Maitreya sheared three feet and three inches of hemp. Only when it fitted perfectly, did the hat
            cover his lower chin completely.<br><br>
            All of the gods were eating uncooked food in those times, when Maitreya had an idea. They were eating raw
            grains of rice because there was no fire. Whenever he ate one som or one mal of raw grains of rice, Maitreya
            thought that it would be better to eat cooked rather than uncooked grains of rice.<br><br>
            Maitreya thought, 'I can't possibly live like this. I will have to discover the origins of water and fire
            because only I can do it.' <br><br>
            Maitreya captured a grasshopper, and put him on a chair reserved for criminals, and hit his kneecap with a
            stick three times.<br><br>
            'Talk, grasshopper! Do you know the origins of water and fire?' asked Maitreya.<br><br>
            'I'm just a trifle that drinks dewdrops at night and basks in the sun by day. How can I know about it? I
            think you had better ask the frog which came into being earlier than I', answered the grasshopper.<br><br>
            Maitreya thought that the grasshopper's idea was good, so he captured a frog and hit its kneecap with a
            stick three times.<br><br>
            'Listen, frog! Do you know about the origins of water and fire?' asked Maitreya.<br><br>
            'I'm just a trifle that drinks dewdrops at night and basks in the sun by day. How can I know about it? If
            you want to know, why don't you ask a mouse two or three years older than me? Maybe he will know' , replied
            the frog.<br><br>
            Maitreya thought the frog's suggestion was a good one, so he caught a mouse and hit its kneecap with a stick
            three times.<br><br>
            'Say, mouse! Do you know about the origins of water and fire?' asked Maitreya.<br><br>
            If I tell you, what will you give me as a reward?' replied the mouse.<br><br>
            'I will permit you to be in charge of all rice chests in the world', replied Maitreya.<br><br>
            'If that's so, I will tell you. There are two stones, one is quartz, and the other is cast iron from Mount
            Kumjong. If you strike the two stones together vigor-ously, you will get fire. And there is a spring on
            Mount Soha. If you see the murmuring spring, you will find the origin of water', replied the mouse.<br><br>
            Finally, Maitreya thought about the birth of humans, once he knew the origins of water and fire.<br><br>
            Maitreya prayed to the heavens with one hand raised holding a silver tray and the other hand raised holding
            a gold tray. From the heavens, the heads of five bugs fell onto the silver tray and the heads of five bugs
            fell onto the gold tray. The five gold bugs grew into men and the five silver bugs grew into women. These
            men and women married, and mankind was started by these five couples.<br><br>
            Mankind enjoyed peaceful times eating one-som or one-mal of rice. But Sakyamuni (Sokga), who was descended
            from the sky, intended to steal Maitreya's world.<br><br>
            'This world is still mine, not yours', said Maitreya.<br><br>
            Your world has already gone. Now I will have my world', replied Sakyamuni.<br><br>
            'If you want to deprive me of my world, we should see who will win in a contest, filthy, ignoble Sakyamuni!'
            suggested Maitreya.<br><br>
            Sakyamuni agreed to the contest. So Maitreya suspended a gold-bottle with a gold-string and Sakyamuni hung a
            silver-bottle with a silver-string in the centre of the East Sea.<br><br>
            Before the match started, Maitreya said, 'If my bottle's string breaks first, the world is yours. But if
            your bottle's string breaks first, it is not your world yet.'<br><br>
            Sakyamuni's string broke first. But Sakyamuni demanded another contest.<br><br>
            'Let the winner be the one who freezes the water of Songch'on River in summer', said Maitreya.<br><br>
            Sakyamuni said, 'I accept.' Whereupon Maitreya performed 'the winter solstice-rite,' and Sakyamuni carried
            out the 'onset of spring-rite'. Maitreya froze the river first, and Sakyamuni lost the contest. But again
            Sakyamuni demanded another contest.<br><br>
            'After we set a peony on our knees we will lay ourselves down. If the peony flowers are on my knees, this
            world is mine. But if it blooms on your knees, this world is yours', replied Maitreya.<br><br>
            Sakyamuni agreed to Maitreya's proposal. But tricky Sakyamuni like a thief took a light sleep, whereas
            Maitreya took a deep sleep. When night fell, the peony bloomed on Maitreya's knee. When Sakyamuni saw it, he
            quickly plucked the flower and put it on his own knee.<br><br>
            'You are filthy and base, Sakyamuni! The peony bloomed on my knee. You stole my flower to put on your knee.
            Because of this the flower will wither within ten days and even if the flower is planted, it will not last
            for ten years' cursed Maitreya.<br><br>
            Maitreya was so annoyed with Sakyamuni's devious behaviour that he wanted nothing more to do with him. So,
            Maitreya decided to pass his world to Sakyamuni.<br><br>
            'Filthy and base Sakyamuni! If the world becomes yours, every village will have poles for shamanic rituals,
            every family will have shamans, and every clan will have professional female entertainers, widows, rebels,
            and butchers. And of three thousand monks a thousand will become house-holders. If this happens, your world
            will go to the dogs.'<br><br>
            Just three days after Maitreya predicted this, a thousand of the three thousand monks became
            householders.<br><br>
            Maitreya ran away as soon as he saw them.<br><br>
            Sakyamuni and the monks looked for Maitreya. When they advanced into the mountains, there was a roe deer.
            Sakyamuni caught the roe deer and gave the three thousand monks the roe deer meat on three thousand
            skewers.<br><br>
            "To eat the meat on three thousand skewers, cut down the old trees on this mountain to make a fire', said
            Sakyamuni.<br><br>
            At this time two of the three thousands monks got up and threw the meat away.<br><br>
            They each shouted, 'I want to become a shamanist god!'<br><br>
            After they said this, they died at that place and later turned into rocks and pine trees on the
            mountain.<br><br>
            Because of this, people perform an annual sacrificial rite for the spirits of the mountains and streams on a
            mountain with raw rice and cooked rice, and people go to a mountain to enjoy a spring picnic.

          <h2 class="mb-4">Norse Creation Myth</h2>
          <p>
            At the beginning of time, nothing existed. The earth, the gentle oceans lapping up against its shores, man
            and animal had not yet been created. Only a great yawning abyss was present in the void of nothingness. Out
            of the abyss, a land of eternal mist, darkness and terrible cold was formed to the North; to all beings,
            this land was known as Niflheim. In the midst of the Dark Land surged a fountain known as vergelmir, from
            which spread the freezing glacial waters of twelve rivers throughout the void. To the South lay the land of
            Fire, Muspellsheim; an infernal region of unbearable, unsatiable heat and flames. From there poured rivers
            of fire whose waters contained a bitter poison which, little by little, gathered and became a solid mass.
            From the ice flowing from the North, this mass of venom was covered in a thick layer of frost. With the heat
            blowing from the lands of Fire, the frost began to melt, and the giant Y mir was bom from poison and
            ice.<br><br>
            Ymir became the father of all giants. On the night of his creation, he fell asleep near the lands of the
            South and became completely bathed in sweat: from under his left arm were born man and woman, both giants
            like him. At the same time, the block of ice from which he was born gave forth the great cow Audumla, the
            wet-nurse of the giants. Y mir refreshed himself from her udders at the beginning of every day, which flowed
            with life-giving milk. Audumla began to lick the salt from the ice to nourish herself, and the heat of her
            tongue and breath yielded first the hair, then the head, and finally the entire body of a being whose name
            was Buri. Buri had a son whose name was Bor, who went on to marry Ymir's daughter, Bestla. With her, he
            fathered the three gods Odin, Vili and Ve.<br><br>
            The three sons of the Giants' race at once began to rebel against their creators, which ended in the
            annihilation of the Giants. They first killed the aged Ymir. So much blood flowed from his shattered body
            that the abyss was filled with it. All of the other Giants drowned in the blood, save Beregelmir and his
            wife, who managed to launch a small boat and escape; it is from them that a new race of giants
            issued.<br><br>
            After the death of Ymir, the sons of Bor raised his body from the depths of the sea of blood and created
            earth with it, which became known as Midgard or the 'Middle Abode', for it was situated halfway between
            Niflheim and Muspellsheim. The flesh of Ymir became the land on which we live, and his blood became the
            boundless ocean. From his bones, the gods created the mountains; from his hair, they created the trees. They
            took the skull of Ymir and raised it up on four pillars of bone and made it into the Vault of the Heavens,
            in which they kept the sparks of fire that escaped from Muspellsheim. These sparks became the sun, moon and
            the countless stars in the night sky, their course throughout the sky was regulated and kept constant,
            creating night and day; summer and winter. With the sun in the sky, it threw its golden rays across the
            barren earth, and the first blades of green grass appeared.<br><br>
            Soon other gods came to join Odin, Vili and Ve. They seemed to appear out of the abyss, having no father or
            mother. Together the gods created their dwelling place, which became known as Asgard 'The Dwelling of the
            Aesir', in which each of them have a grand mansion. This land was created above Midgard, so that the gods
            could keep watch over the world that they were creating. To get back and forth between Midgard and Asgard
            they created the great Rainbow Bridge known as Bifröst, which was guarded by Heimdall, the god of
            Bifröst.<br><br>
            As the gods gathered, they deliberated on the manner in which the earth might best be peopled. In the
            rotting corpse of Ymir, grubs were beginning to form. The gods changed all of the grubs into the dwarves,
            giving them human form and imbuing them with reason. Because the dwarves were born from the flesh of Ymir,
            the gods decided that they shall continue to live as they had since their birth, hidden from the light of
            the sun in the flesh of their creator. Soon the light of the sun became deadly to them, turning them into
            stone at the slightest exposure. There were no women among the dwarves; hence they were not able to have
            children. Therefore, the gods gave the dwarves two princes, who had the ability to mould new dwarves out of
            the stones of the earth. Thus the race of dwarves endlessly continued.<br><br>
            Men were created from the vegetable world by the gods Odin, Hoenir and Lodur. One day the three gods were
            travelling across the barren earth and came across two trees with life-less twisted trunks. Odin shaped each
            of the trees into a man and a woman, and gave each of them breath. Hoenir gave them a soul and the ability
            to reason. Lodur gave them warmth and the fresh colours of life. The man was called Ask and his wife was
            Embla, and they proceeded to create the race of man.<br><br>
            The land of Niflheim (or Niflhel) became the land where the dead would go after their time on earth had
            elapsed. It was known as a land of eternal sleet and frost. The goddess Hel became the ruler of this domain,
            and her faithful hound, Garm, guarded the entrance to prevent the dead from ever leaving and the living from
            entering.<br><br>
            Out of the chaos of the abyss rose the three Norns, goddesses of Fate. Their names were Urd (Past), Verdandi
            (Present), and Skuld (Future). Urd appeared in the form of a shrivelled old hag, while Verdandi was a women
            in her prime. Skuld was a beautiful young maiden. Together the three Norns cared for the Life-Tree,
            Yggdrasil until the day of Ragnarok when it is destined to die.<br><br>
            After the creation of the different level, or planes of existence, the great ash tree Yggdrasil began to
            grow and connect all of the levels. Its first root form in the land of Niflheim, from this root bubbled the
            spring of Hvergelmir, the source of the primitive rivers. The second root of the great tree extended into
            the land of the giants, covered with frost and ice. This is where the fountain Mimir flowed. This spring was
            a source of great wisdom from which Odin desired to drink, however the price demanded for a few draughts was
            the loss of one of his eyes. The third root extended all the way up into the heavens, and issued the spring
            Urd. This is where the Norns resided, drawing water from this well at the beginning of each day and
            sprinkling it on the roots of Yggdrasil so that it would not wither away.<br><br>
            In the highest branches of the tree sat a golden cock, which kept a constant vigilance of the horizon to
            warn the gods whenever their ancient enemies, the Giants, were preparing to attack them. Under Yggdrasil,
            the horn of the god Heimdall was hidden, whose sound would announce the final battle of the Aesir against
            all whom wished to cause their downfall. Near the trunk of the tree was a place of eternal peace, where the
            god would meet daily to render justice. In its branches the goat Heidrun browsed; she gave Odin's warriors
            the milk with which they were nourished.<br><br>
            There existed demons that would constantly strive to destroy Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life. A cunning monster,
            the serpent Nidhögg, sat at the base of the third root and gnawed at it ceaselessly. Four stags wandered at
            the base of the tree and would nibble off all of the young green shoots, preventing further growth of the
            tree. Thankfully, due to the careful attention given by the Norns, the tree was able to flourish.<br><br>
            At the time of the creation of the world, it was foretold that it would not be eternal. In the Day of the
            End, Ragnarok, the earth would be torn asunder in a mighty battle between the gods of the Aesir and the
            Giants. Great battles of might and magic would be fought, reducing all life to ashes. Yggdrasil would fall,
            sending the layers of the world crashing down. The hound Garm, guarding the entrance to Niflheim would flee
            in terror, and the dead will escape, rising again to the earth as plagues and disease to fight along side
            the gods. In the end of the battle, everything would be destroyed; the gods, giants, men and animals would
            cease to exist.<br><br>

          <h2 class="mb-4">Egyptian Creation Myth</h2>
          <p>
            In the beginning, there was nothing but an idea. The idea was remembered. It then became conscious. Finally,
            it became a wish to create. So it came to pass that out of nothing came the power to live and to grow, even
            in emptiness. <br><br>
            And it came to pass that out of this power to live and to grow came the deep, dark, long, and gloomy Night,
            a presence felt, but unseen, in the sightless, empty universe. <br><br>
            And it came to pass that out of this power that was the Night came life, in the form of the sky,
            far-reaching Father Rangi. Father Rangi lived with rosy dawn's pale light and created the moon. He lived
            with golden morn's warmer rays and created the sun. Then he tossed both the moon and the sun into the deep,
            dark, and gloomy Night so that they would light the universe and be its eyes. Now there were both Night and
            Day. <br><br>
            Father Rangi then lived with Mother Papa, the Earth. In love, he lay upon her, and they created land.
            <br><br>
            Father Rangi and Mother Papa produced many children, who lived in the darkness of the small space that
            existed between their parents. Mother Papa's body was covered with low planes, and the sea was as black as
            Father Rangi. <br>
            Father Rangi loved Mother Papa and clung to her. No light could come between them. Their first children
            became tired of living in everlasting darkness, and their six sons met together to discuss what they could
            do to improve their situation. <br>
            "We can kill Father Rangi and Mother Papa, or we can force them apart. For only then will we be able to
            escape this darkness. Which will it be?" <br><br>
            Tu, the fierce father and god of war-spirited human beings, finally exclaimed, "We must kill them!" <br><br>
            To these words, Tane, father and god of trees, birds, and insects, replied, "No, it would be better to push
            Father Rangi away from Mother Papa, to live like a stranger far above us. Meanwhile, we could let Mother
            Papa remain where she is under our feet, so that she can continue to nourish us with the foods that she
            grows for us." <br><br>
            Tane's words were so wise that even the warrior Tu was quick to agree with his brother's advice. But one
            brother, Tawhiri, father and god of all winds and storms, stood alone against the others. Now and forever,
            he separated himself from his brothers, fearing the loss of his own power and regretting his parents'
            separation. In defiance he held his breach and would do nothing. So it came to pass that five of Father
            Rangi and Mother Papa's six sons made an effort to try to separate their parents. <br><br>
            First came Rongo, father and god of the sweet potato and other edible cultivated plants. He lacked the
            necessary strength to separate Father Rangi and Mother Papa. Next came Tangaroa, father and god of all fish
            and sea reptiles. Tangaroa was stronger than Rongo, but no matter how hard he pushed, he could not separate
            Father Rangi and Mother Papa either. Third came Haumia, father and god of the fern root and other edible
            wild plants. However he, too, was unsuccessful. Then, confident in his own strength, Tu, the fierce father
            and god of war-spirited human beings, grabbed an axelike tool and chopped away at the tendons that bound his
            parents together. The blood from these tendons created sacred red clay. However, Father Rangi and Mother
            Papa remained bound together. <br> <br>
            Finally, Tane, father and god of forests, birds, and insects, took his turn. Just as a young tree pushes up
            from the earth, increasing in strength as it grows, so Tane slowly used his body to force his parents apart.
            First he tried to use his arms and his hands, but all their might could not move Father Rangi up and away
            from Mother Papa. Then, he decided to rest his head and shoulders against Mother Papa and to use his feet to
            push up against Father Rangi. Very, very slowly, Tane's continuous pressure stretched and then tore the
            tendons that bound his parents together. Despite their anguished cries, he pushed Mother Papa far under him
            and thrust Father Rangi far above him. So it came to pass that Tane freed all of Father Rangi and Mother
            Papa's other children from their dark world. <br><br>
            Tawhiri, father and god of winds and storms, had sympathized with his parents' love for each other and had
            considered their attachment to be appropriate. Living in darkness was also compatible with the nature of his
            power, whereas living in a lovely, bright world was not. Tawhiri greeted Tane's success with jealousy and
            anger. Tane had created exactly what Tawhiri dreaded—Day, with its power to push away the gloomy darkness of
            Night and light up and beautify the universe. The father and god of winds and storms feared that there would
            no longer be a place for him in this new world. <br><br>
            So it came to pass that Tawhiri hurried to join Father Rangi. The god of the sky and weather was pleased to
            have this son's companionship and help. Together, they worked to create many great winds and storms that
            flew north, south, east, and west, battering those on Mother Papa with their blows. Tawhiri sent winds that
            delivered fiery blows, winds that delivered freezing blows, winds that dumped rain, and winds that dumped
            sleet. Finally, Tawhiri came down to his mother's realm as a hurricane. He surprised Tane by tearing apart
            his forests and leaving his mighty trees to rot away, broken and useless upon the earth. <br><br>
            Having felled Tane's forests, Tawhiri then attacked Tangaroa's seas. Tangaroa loved to live along the
            seashore, but now he found himself battered by great tides, churning whirlpools, and mountainous waves.
            Terrified, he ran and hid in the deepest part of the ocean, where Tawhiri would not be able to find him.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, Tangaroa's two grandchildren, the father of fish and the father of reptiles, together with their
            own children, argued about whether they would be safer on land or in the sea. Shark tried to persuade Lizard
            and the other members of his family to seek refuge in the sea with the fish. "If you are captured on land,"
            he warned, "you will have to endure death by fire before being eaten!" <br><br>
            "That may be," Lizard replied, "but all of you will be caught and eaten as well!" <br><br>
            And so it came to pass that the children of Tangaroa separated forever. Tangaroa became furious with Tane
            for sheltering Lizard and his children in the forests, and from that time to this, the god of the sea has
            been at war with his brother Tane. Tangaroa continues to nibble away at the forests that grow along the
            seashore, causing Tane's trees to fall prey to his waves. And Tangaroa enjoys chewing the wood from houses
            and trees that floods bring him. Meanwhile, Tane provides his brother Tu's children with the means to
            capture Tangaroa's sea-bound children by supplying human beings with wood for their canoes, fishing spears,
            and fish-hooks, and with flax and other plant fibers for their fishing nets. In response, Tangaroa attacks
            Tu's children with his waves and rides, capsizing their canoes and claiming their lives. <br><br>
            During the war between Tangaroa and Tane, revenge continued to occupy Tawhiri 's thoughts and actions. After
            he was satisfied with his punishment of Tangaroa, he attacked Rongo and Haumia, the gods of planted and wild
            food. However, Mother Papa came to their rescue. Knowing that her other children needed the sweet potato and
            the fern root in order to survive, she hid Rongo and Haumia where Tawhiri could not find them. <br><br>
            Finally, Tawhiri attacked his last brother, Tu, the father and god of war-spirited human beings, and the one
            brother who originally had suggested that the gods kill Father Rangi and Mother Papa. However, Tu was ready
            for the assault. He placed his feet upon Mother Papa's chest, where they took their strength from their
            mother. Thus Tu survived Tawhiri's strongest storm-winds. Tu's victory caused Tawhiri to give up his battle.
            <br><br>
            Peace had little opportunity to reign on earth, however. Once Tu, the eternal warrior, had proved himself
            against Tawhiri, he became angry with his four other brothers. Not one of the gods of the earth and the sea
            had shown the courage and strength against Tawhiri that he had. Tane had been surprised by Tawhiri's attack
            and had made no effort to stop the father and god of winds and storms from destroying his forests. Tangaroa
            had avoided any confrontation with Tawhiri and, instead, had taken refuge in the depths of the sea. Rongo
            and Haumia had let Mother Papa protect them from Tawhiri by hiding them. <br><br>
            Tu was most angered by the fact that not one of his brothers had had the courage and the sense of loyalty to
            help him in his own fight against Tawhiri. The eternal warrior, therefore, set out to punish the four of
            them by taking control of their kingdoms. <br><br>
            The fierce father and god of war-spirited human beings decided to attack Tane's children first, before they
            became numerous enough to outnumber and overwhelm his own children. He fashioned leaves into nooses and hung
            them cleverly to trap Tane's birds. Once caught, he defiled them by cooking them, and then he ate
            them.<br><br>
            Next, Tu attacked Tangaroa's children. He wove the flax from Tane's plants into nets and dragged them
            through the sea to catch Tangaroa's fish. These, too, he defiled by cooking them, and then he ate them.
            <br><br>
            Finally, Tu attacked the children of Rongo and Haumia. He fashioned a digging stick from one of Tane's trees
            and wove a flaxen basket from one of Tane's plants. With these, he dug up and collected the sweet potato and
            the fern root. Once again, he defiled them by cooking them, and then he ate them. <br><br>
            So it has come to pass that, from the time that Tu conquered Tane, Tangaroa, Rongo, and Haumia, the warrior
            god and his human children have dominated and eaten the children of these gods of earth and sea. To this
            day, the human family continues to eat Tane's birds, Tangaroa's fish, Rongo's sweet potatoes, and Haumia's
            fern roots. Tu has never been able to gain power over Tawhiri, but, to this day, he continues to fight him,
            for Tawhiri's winds and storms remain a destructive force on both earth and sea.

          <h2 class="mb-4">Yoruba Creation Myth</h2>
          <p>
            In the beginning the universe consisted only of the sky above and the water and wild marshland below.
            Olorun, the god who possessed the most power and the greatest knowledge, ruled the sky, while the goddess
            Olokun ruled the endless waters and wild marshes. Olokun was content with her kingdom, even though it
            contained neither vegetation nor animals nor human beings.<br><br>
            However, the young god Obatala was not satisfied. As he looked down from the sky, he said to himself, "The
            world below needs something of interest! Everything is water-soaked, and not one living thing enlivens the
            area! I must talk with Olorun and see what can be done to improve the situation."<br><br>
            Obatala said to Olorun, "Poor Olokun rules nothing but marshland, mist, and water! What she needs in her
            kingdom are mountains and valleys, forests and fields. All kinds of creatures and plants could live on that
            solid land."<br><br>
            Olorun replied, ''Of course, solid land would be far better than this endless expanse of water. But who can
            create it? And how?"<br><br>
            "With your permission," Obatala replied, "I will create solid land."<br><br>
            "It is always my pleasure to give you whatever you wish, Obarala," Olorun replied. "You know that I love you
            as my son!"<br><br>
            So Obatala went to the house of Orunmila, the oldest son of Olorun, who had the gift of prophecy. Orunmila
            understood the secrets of existence, including fate and the future.<br><br>
            Obatala said to Orunmila, "Your father has given me permission to create solid land where now nothing exists
            except endless water and wild marshland. With your superior knowledge, you can teach me how to begin my
            project. I want to populate the earth with living beings who will be able to raise crops and build
            villages."<br><br>
            Orunmila replied, "First, Obatala, you must acquire a chain of gold long enough to reach from the sky above
            to the waters below. Then you must fill a snail's shell with sand. Finally, you must place that shell, a
            white hen, a black cat, and a palm nut in a bag and carry them with you as you climb down the chain to the
            wild marshland. That is how I advise you to begin your project."<br><br>
            "Thank you, Orunmila," Obatala replied. "I will find the goldsmith and begin at once."<br><br>
            The goldsmith said, "I will make you a chain of the length you need if you will bring me the gold I need to
            fashion it. I do not think you will find enough gold in the sky. But ask each of the gods for whatever gold
            he or she possesses, and you may succeed. I wish you well!"<br><br>
            Obatala approached the gods one by one. To each god he said, "I plan to create solid land where now there is
            nothing bur water and wild marshland. Then I will create all sorts of plants and creatures to live on that
            land. Before I can begin, I need the goldsmith to make me a chain that will stretch from the sky above to
            the waters below. Will you contribute whatever gold you possess?"<br><br>
            The gods were sympathetic to Obatala's cause. They gave him their gold: necklaces, bracelets, rings, and
            even gold dust.<br><br>
            The goldsmith examined the gold Obatala had collected and said, "Can you not find more gold? This will not
            be enough!"<br><br>
            "It is the best I can do," Obatala replied. "I have asked every god in the sky, and each has given me
            whatever he or she owned. Make as long a chain as you can, with a hook at one end."<br><br>
            When the chain was ready, Orunmila accompanied Obatala while he hooked one end of the chain to the edge of
            the sky and lowered the rest of it toward the waters far below. Orunmila gave Obatala the sand-filled
            snail's shell, the white hen, the black cat, and the palm nut. One by one, Obatala put them into a bag,
            which he slung over his shoulder. Then he said farewell to Orunmila and began to climb down the golden
            chain.<br><br>
            Obatala climbed lower and lower and lower. When he was only halfway down, he saw that he was leaving the
            world of light and entering the world of twilight.<br><br>
            Again he climbed lower and lower and lower. As he reached the end of the chain, he could feel the mist
            rising cool and wet upon him and hear the splashing of the waves as they crashed upon the sea. But he could
            see that he was still far above the ocean.<br><br>
            'I cannot jump from here," he thought. "The distance is so great chat I will drown!"<br><br>
            Then, from the sky fur above, Orunmila called our, "Obatala! Use the sand in your snail shell!"<br><br>
            Obatala reached into the bag at his side, withdrew the snail's shell, and poured the sand on the waters
            below him.<br><br>
            No sooner had he finished when Orunmila called out, "Obatala! Free the white hen!" Obatala reached into the
            bag at his side, withdrew the white hen, and dropped it on the waters where he had poured the sand.<br><br>
            The hen fluttered down, landed upon the sandy waters, and immediately began to scatter the sand by
            scratching at it. Wherever the sand fell, it formed dry land. The larger piles of sand became hills, while
            the smaller piles became valleys.<br><br>
            Obatala let go of the golden chain and jumped to the earth. He named the place where he landed Ife. He
            walked with pleasure upon the solid land that he had created. The earth now extended further in all
            directions than his eyes could see. It was still completely devoid of life, but it was a beginning.<br><br>
            Obatala dug a hole in the dry land and buried his palm nut in the soil. Immediately, a palm tree emerged and
            grew to its full height. The mature tree dropped its nuts upon the land, and they also quickly grew to
            maturity. Obatala built himself a house of bark and thatched the roof with palm leaves. He then set tied
            down in Ife with his black cat for company.<br><br>
            Olorun wished to know how Obatala was progressing with his plan, so he sent his servant, the chameleon, down
            the golden chain to find out.<br><br>
            When the lizard arrived, Obatala said to him, "Tell Olorun, ruler of the sky, that I am pleased with the
            land I have created and the vegetation I have planted. But it is always twilight here. I miss the brightness
            of the sky!"<br><br>
            When the chameleon gave Obatala's message to Olorun, the ruler of the sky smiled and said, "For you,
            Obatala, I will create the sun!" Once Olorun tossed the sun into the sky, it shed light and warmth upon Ife
            as it moved across the sky on its daily journey.<br><br>
            Days passed. Months passed. Obatala continued to live on the earth that he had created with only his black
            car for company. Then one day he said to himself. "I love my cat, bur its companionship does not satisfy me.
            I would be happier if creatures more like myself could live in lfe with me. Let me see what I can
            do."<br><br>
            Obatala began to dig in the soil. He found that the particles held together in his hand, for the substance
            he dug up was clay. He laughed as he shaped little figures just like himself. One by one he finished them
            and set them aside to dry. Obatala worked on and on so enthusiastically that he was not aware of how tired
            and thirsty he was.<br><br>
            Finally his fatigue overcame him. "What I need is some wine to drink!" he thought. Obatala placed his last
            clay figure upon the ground and went off to make palm wine from the juice of the palm tree. Obatala drank
            bowl after bowl of the fermented palm juice, for he was very thirsty. He did not realize it, but the wine
            made him drunk.<br><br>
            Obatala returned to his task of making clay figures, but his fingers were clumsy now. The figures he created
            were no longer perfect. Some had arms char were too short, some had legs of uneven length, and some had
            backs that were curved. Obatala was too drunk to notice the difference. He continued to fashion one figure
            after another. In time, he was satisfied with the number of clay figures that he had created.<br><br>
            Obatala then called out to the ruler of the sky, "Hear me, Olorun, you who are like a father to me. I have
            created figures out of clay, but only you can breathe life into them and make them into living people. I ask
            you to do this for me so that I can have human companions in Ife."<br><br>
            So it came to pass that Olorun breathed life into the figures Obatala had created, and they became active,
            thinking human beings. When they noticed Obatala's house, they fashioned houses for themselves and placed
            them nearby. Thus they created the first Yoruba village in lfe where there had been only a solitary
            house.<br><br>
            When the effects of the palm wine wore off, Obatala realized that the creatures he had fashioned while he
            was drunk were imperfect. With a sad heart he announced, "I promise that I will never drink palm wine again!
            Moreover, I will devote myself to protecting all the people who have suffered from my drunkenness." And
            Obatala became the protector of all those who are born deformed.<br><br>
            The people prospered, and the Yoruba village of lfe grew into a city. Iron did not yet exist, so Obatala
            gave his people a copper knife and a wooden hoe to use as tools. The Yoruba cleared the land and began to
            raise grain and yams.<br><br>
            Obatala eventually tired of ruling his city of Ife, so he climbed up the golden chain and returned to his
            home in the sky. Thereafter, he divided his time between his home in the sky and his home in the Yoruba
            city.<br><br>
            The gods never tired of hearing Obatala describe the city that he had created on earth. Many of them were so
            fascinated with what they heard about lfe that they decided to leave their sky homes and live among the
            human beings on earth. As they prepared to leave, the ruler of the sky counseled them. "Remember," Olorun
            said, "that you will have obligations to the humans among whom you live in lfe. You must listen to their
            prayers and protect them. I will give each of you a specific task to fulfill while you are living
            there."<br><br>
            Not every god, however, was pleased with Obatala's success on lfe. Obatala had not consulted the goddess
            Olokun, ruler of the sea, when he had created solid earth and a Yoruba city in her kingdom. As the ruler of
            the sea watched one of the great sky gods usurp her power and rule a large part of her kingdom, she became
            angrier and angrier. Finally she conceived a plan that would avenge Obatala's insult to her honor.<br><br>
            Olokun waited until Ob,mtla had returned to his home in the sky. Then she summoned the great waves of her
            vast ocean and sent them surging across the land that Obatala had created. One after another, the waves
            flooded the earth until water once again flowed as fur as the eye could see, and only marshland existed
            amidst the waves of the ocean. Whole groves of palm trees became uprooted and floated away.<br><br>
            Yams rotted and washed like dead fish upon the surface of the sea. People drowned in their fields, in their
            groves, and in their homes.<br><br>
            Those who still remained alive fled into the hills and cried out to Obatala for help, but he could not hear
            them over the roaring of the waves so far below him. So they sought the god Eshu, who was living among them.
            They knew that he could carry messages to Obatala and to Olorun. "Please return to the kingdom of the sky,"
            they pleaded, "and tell the great gods of the disastrous flood that is destroying us!"<br><br>
            Eshu replied, "You must send a sacrifice along with your message if you want one of the great sky gods to
            listen to you."<br><br>
            The people sacrificed a goat to Obatala and said, "We send this goat as food for Obatala."<br><br>
            "That is not enough," Eshu replied. "I too deserve a gift for the service I am performing for you."<br><br>
            When the people had sacrificed accordingly, Eshu climbed the golden chain and told Obatala about how Olokun
            had flooded lfe and the rest of the earth.<br><br>
            Obatala did not know how to deal with Olokun, so he asked Orunmila for advice.<br><br>
            Orunmila replied, "You rest here in the sky while I go down to lfe. I can make the waters withdraw and the
            land come forth once again."<br><br>
            So it came to pass that Orunmila climbed down the golden chain to the waters that covered lfe and the earth.
            Using his special knowledge, he caused the power of the waves to wane and the waters to retreat. Once the
            waves had subsided, he dried up the marshland and put an end to Olokun's attempt to recover the area that
            she had lost to Obatala.<br><br>
            The people who had survived greeted Orunmila as their hero and pleaded with him to stay and protect them.
            Orunmila had no desire to remain in Ife, but he agreed to stay long enough to teach the gods and humans who
            lived there how to tell the future so that they could begin to control the forces they could not see. When
            he had done so, Orunmila returned to his home in the sky, but, like Obatala, he often climbed down the
            golden chain to see how life was progressing in lfe.<br><br>
            The ruler of the sea made one final attempt to remain the equal of the ruler of the sky. Olokun was an
            excellent weaver of cloth, and she possessed equal skill in dyeing the fabrics she had woven. So the ruler
            of the sea sent a message to Olorun, ruler of the sky, challenging him to a weaving contest.<br><br>
            Olorun said to himself, "Olokun is a far better weaver than I am. However, I cannot give her the
            satisfaction of knowing that she is superior to me in anything. If I do, she will exert her powers in other
            ways as well, and that will disrupt the order that now exists throughout the universe. Somehow I must appear
            to accept her challenge and yet avoid participating in her contest. Now, how can I do this?"<br><br>
            Olorun thought and thought. Suddenly his eyes sparkled. With a smile, he summoned his messenger, the
            chameleon, to his side. "Go before Olokun, ruler of the sea," he ordered, "with this message: 'The ruler of
            the sky greets the ruler of the sea. He asks you to display to his messenger samples of the cloth chat you
            have woven. Let the chameleon judge your skill. If your cloth is as beautiful as you say it is, then the
            ruler of the sky will compete with you in the contest you have suggested."'<br><br>
            The chameleon climbed down the golden chain and gave the goddess Olorun's message.<br><br>
            Olokun was happy to obey Olorun's request. She put on a bright green skirt, and to her amazement the
            chameleon turned a beautiful shade of bright green. She next put on a bright orange skirt, and to her
            amazement the chameleon turned a beautiful shade of bright orange. She then put on a bright red skirt, and
            to her amazement the chameleon turned a beautiful shade of bright red. One by one, the goddess Olokun put on
            skirts of various bright colors, and each time the chameleon turned into the particular color chat she was
            wearing. Finally Olokun gave up.<br><br>
            The goddess said to herself, "If someone as ordinary as Olorun's messenger can duplicate the bright colors
            of my finest fabrics, how can I hope to compete against the greatest of the gods?"<br><br>
            She said to the chameleon, "Tell your master that the ruler of the sea sends her greetings to the ruler of
            the sky. Tell him that I acknowledge his superiority in weaving and in all other pursuits as well. Olorun is
            indeed the greatest of the gods!"<br><br>
            So it came to pass that peace returned between the ruler of the sky and the ruler of the sea, and that peace
            restored order in the universe.<br><br>

          <p>
            When on high the heaven had not been named,<br>
            Firm ground below had not been called by name,<br>
            Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter,<br>
            (And) Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all,<br>
            Their waters commingling as a single body;<br>
            No reed hut had been matted, no marsh land had appeared,<br>
            When no gods whatever had been brought into being,<br>
            Uncalled by name, their destinies undetermined-<br>
            Then it was that the gods were formed within them.<br>
            Lahmu and Lahamu were brought forth, by name they were called.<br>
            For aeons they grew in age and stature.<br>
            Anshar and Kishar were formed, surpassing the others.<br>
            They prolonged the days, added on the years.<br>
            Anu was their son, of his fathers the rival;<br>
            Yea, Anshar's first born, Anu was his equal.<br>
            Anu begot in his image Nudimmud.<br>
            This Nudimmud was of his fathers the master;<br>
            Of broad wisdom, understanding, mighty in strength,<br>
            Mightier by far than his grandfather, Anshar.<br>
            He had no rival among the gods, his brothers.<br>
            The divine brothers banded together,<br>
            They disturbed Tiamat as they surged back and forth,<br>
            Yea, they troubled the mood of Tiamat<br>
            By their hilarity in the Abode of Heaven.<br>
            Apsu could not lessen their clamour<br>
            And Tiamat was speechless at their ways.<br>
            Their doings were loathsome unto (. . .).<br>
            Unsavory were their ways; they were overbearing.<br>
            Then Apsu, the begetter of the great gods,<br>
            Cried out, addressing Mummu, his vizier:<br>
            "O Mummu. my vizier, who rejoicest my spirit,<br>
            Come hither and let us go to Tiamat!"<br>
            They went and sat down before Tiamat,<br>
            Exchanging counsel about the gods, their first born.<br>
            Apsu, opening his mouth,<br>
            Said unto resplendent Tiamat:<br>
            "Their ways are verily loathsome unto me.<br>
            By day I find no relief, nor repose by night.<br>
            I will destroy, I will wreck their ways,<br>
            That quiet may be restored. Let us have rest!"<br>
            As soon as Tiamat heard this,<br>
            She was wroth and called out to her husband.<br>
            She cried out aggrieved, as she raged all alone,<br>
            Injecting woe into her mood:<br>
            "What? Should we destroy what we have built?<br>
            Their ways are indeed troublesome, but let us attend kindly!"<br>
            Ill wishing and ungracious was Mummu's advice:<br>
            "Do destroy, my father, the mutinous ways.<br>
            Then shalt thou have relief by day and rest by night!"<br>
            When Apsu heard this, his face grew radiant<br>
            Because of the evil he planned against the gods, his sons.<br>
            As for Mummu, by the neck he embraced him<br>
            As (that one) sat down on his knees to kiss him.<br>
            (Now) whatever they plotted between them<br>
            Was repeated unto the gods, their first born.<br>
            When the gods heard (this), they were astir,<br>
            (Then) lapsed into silence and remained speechless,<br>
            Surpassing in wisdom, accomplished, resourceful,<br>
            Ea, the all wise, saw through their scheme.<br>
            A master design against it he devised and setup,<br>
            Made artful his spell against it, surpassing and holy.<br>
            He recited it and made it subsist in the deep,<br>
            As he poured sleep upon him. Sound asleep he lay.<br>
            When Apsu he made prone, drenched with sleep,<br>
            Mummu, the adviser, was impotent to move,<br>
            He loosened his band, tore off his tiara,<br>
            Removed his halo (and) put it on himself.<br>
            Having fettered Apsu, he slew him.<br>
            Mummu he bound and left behind lock.<br>
            Having thus upon Apsu established his dwelling,<br>
            He laid hold on Mummu, holding him by the nose rope.<br>
            After he vanquished and trodden down his foes,<br>
            Ea, his triumph over his enemies secured,<br>
            In his sacred chamber in profound sleep he rested.<br>
            He named it "Apsu," for shrines he assigned (it).<br>
            In that same place his cult hut he founded.<br>
            Ea and Damkina, his wife, dwelled (there) in splendor.<br>
            In the chamber of fates, the abode of destinies,<br>
            A god was engendered, most potent and wisest of gods.<br>
            In the heart of Apsu was Marduk created,<br>
            In the heart of holy Apsu was Marduk created.<br>
            He who begot him was Ea, his father;<br>
            She who conceived him was Damkina, his mother.<br>
            The breast of goddesses did she suck.<br>
            The nurse that nursed him filled him with awesomeness.<br>
            Alluring was his figure, sparkling the lift in his eyes.<br>
            Lordly was his gait, commanding from of old.<br>
            When Ea saw him, the father who begot him,<br>
            He exulted and glowed, his heart filled with gladness.<br>
            He rendered him perfect and endowed him with a double godhead.<br>
            Greatly exalted was he above them, exceeding throughout.<br>
            Perfect were his members beyond comprehension,<br>
            Unsuited for understanding, difficult to perceive.<br>
            Four were his eyes, four were his ears;<br>
            When he moved his lips, fire blazed forth.<br>
            Large were all hearing organs,<br>
            And the eyes, in like number, scanned all things.<br>
            He was the loftiest of the gods, surpassing was his stature;<br>
            His members were enormous, he was exceedingly tall.<br>
            "My little son, my little son!<br>
            My son, the Sun! Sun of the heavens!"<br>
            Clothed with the halo of the ten gods, he was strong to the utmost,<br>
            As their awesome flashes were heaped upon him.<br>

            Disturbed was Tiamat, astir night and day.<br>
            The gods, in malice, contributed to the storm.<br>
            Their insides having plotted evil.<br>
            To Tiamat these brothers said:<br>
            "When they slew Apsu, thy consort,<br>
            Thou didst not aid him but remaindest still.<br>
            Although he fashioned the awesome Saw,<br>
            Thy insides are diluted and so we can have no rest.<br>
            Let Apsu, thy consort, be in thy mind<br>
            And Mummu, who has been vanquished! Thou are left alone.<br>

            Then joined issue Tiamat and Marduk, wisest of gods,<br>
            They swayed in single combat, locked in battle.<br>
            The lord spread out his net to enfold her,<br>
            The Evil Wind, which followed behind, he let loose in her face.<br>
            When Tiamat opened her mouth to consume him,<br>
            He drove the Evil Wind that she close not her lips.<br>
            As the fierce winds charged her belly,<br>
            Her body was distended and her mouth was wide open.<br>
            He released the arrow, it tore her belly,<br>
            It cut through her insides, splitting the heart.<br>
            Having thus subdued her, he extinguished her life.<br>
            He cast down her carcass to stand upon it...<br>
            The lord trod on the legs of Tiamat,<br>
            With his unsparing mace he crushed her skull.<br>
            When the arteries of her blood he had severed,<br>
            The North Wind bore (it) to places undisclosed.<br>
            On seeing this, his fathers were joyful and jubilant,<br>
            They brought gifts of homage, they to him.<br>
            Then the lord paused to view her dead body,<br>
            That he might divide the monster and do artful works.<br>
            He split her like a shellfish into two parts:<br>
            Half of her he set up and ceiled as sky,<br>
            Pulled down the bar and posted guards.<br>
            He bade them to allow not her waters to escape.<br>
            He crossed the heavens and surveyed (its) regions.<br>
            He squared Apsu's quarter, the abode of Nudimmud,<br>
            As the lord measured the dimensions of Apsu.<br>
            The Great Abode, its likeness, he fixed as Esharra,<br>
            The Great Abode, Esharra, which he made as the firmament.<br>
            Anu, Enlil, and Ea he made occupy their places.<br>

            When Marduk hears the words of the gods,<br>
            His heart prompts (him) to fashion artful works.<br>
            Opening his mouth he addresses EA<br>
            To impart the plan he addresses EA<br>
            To impart the plan he had conceived in his heart:<br>
            "Blood I will mass and cause boned to be.<br>
            I will establish a savage, 'man' shall be his name.<br>
            Verily, savage man I will create.<br>
            He shall be charged with the service of the gods<br>
            That they might be at ease! The ways of the gods I will artfully alter.<br>
            Though alike revered, into two (groups) they shall be divided."<br>
            Ea answered him, speaking a word to him.<br>
            To relate to him a scheme for the relief of the gods:<br>
            "Let but one of their brothers be handed over;"<br>
            He alone shall perish that mankind may be fashioned.<br>
            Let the great gods be here in Assembly,<br>
            Let the guilty be handed over that they may endure."<br>
            Marduk summoned the great gods to Assembly;<br>
            Presiding graciously, he issued instructions.<br>
            This utterance the gods pay heed.<br>
            The king addresses a word to the Anunnaki: <br>
            "If your former statement was true,<br>
            Do (now) the truth on oath by me declare!<br>
            Who was it that contrived the uprising,<br>
            And made Tiamat rebel, and joined battle?<br>
            Let him be handed over who contrived the uprising.<br>
            His guilt I will make him bear that you may dwell in peace!"<br>
            The Igigi, the great gods, replied to him,<br>
            To Lugaldimmerankia, counsellor of the gods, their lord:<br>
            "It was Kingu who contrived the uprising,<br>
            And made Tiamat rebel, and joined battle."<br>
            The bound him holding him before Ea.<br>
            They imposed on him his guilt and severed his blood (vessels).<br>
            Out of his blood they fashioned mankind.<br>
            He imposed the service and let free the gods.<br>

            In the beginning was the First World, or Black World. It consisted of a small area of solid land surrounded by burning resin, which provided the only available light. Most of the inhabitants were wingless insects and crawling creatures accustomed to living in holes in the ground, among them red ants, yellow beetles, black beetles, and white locusts. One day the insects gathered together and said, "This place is too small, too dark, and too unpleasant! We must find a new world that will be larger and lighter." <br><br>
            "How can we do that?" asked the ants. "You can see that we are surrounded by fire!" <br><br>
            Dragonfly replied, "We will all make wings for ourselves and fly toward the roof of our world." <br><br>
            The dragonflies, bees, flies, locusts, and ants tied wings to their bodies and flew upward. Locust noticed a crack in the roof through which a blue light came, and he led the insects through that crack into the next world. <br><br>
            The Second World, or Blue World, was larger and lighter than the First World. Each group of insects went off among the grasses and bushes to find a home. They had not gone far before four great birds, White Crane, Blue Heron, Yellow Loon, and Black Loon, flew from the four corners of the world and swooped down upon them. "This is our land!" the birds exclaimed. "You may not remain here! Besides, you will starve here for lack of food. We have to fly far away to the sea in order to find food, and your wings will never carry you that far." <br><br>
            "Have no concern for us," the insects replied. "We have no interest in your food. Here we have leaves, seeds, pollen, and honey. That is more than enough!" <br><br>
            "Then you may stay," the birds replied, "but see to it that you stay far away from us!" <br><br>
            So the insects remained in the Blue World. As time passed, they increased in number until there was not enough food to feed them all. In search of more food, they set out to find where the great birds lived. When the birds spied the swarms of insects flying toward them like great clouds of dust, they summoned all of their own kind to fight the invaders. Led by White Crane, Blue Heron, Yellow Loon, and Black Loon, the birds won the battle. Locust gathered the surviving insects and announced, "We must move to another world. Follow me!" <br><br>
            With many birds flying in close pursuit, the insects followed Locust to the roof of the Blue World, where Blue Wind led them into the Third World, or Yellow World. This world was larger and brighter than the Blue World, and it was populated with animals and human beings. Together, these became known as First People. <br><br>
            Here there was food for all. Grass and bushes grew along springs and rivers, and the mountains that stood to the north, south, east, and west were covered with trees. All living creatures spoke the same language, and they all had the teeth, claws, feet, and wings of insects. <br><br>
            Human beings, however, wore their wings as part of their furry or feathered coats, which they could remove. They lived in caves, and they ate only food they could gather and eat raw, such as nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. <br><br>
            One autumn four gods—White Body, Blue Body, Yellow Body, and Black Body— appeared before First People for four days in succession. Each day they silently made signs and then departed. On the fourth day Black Body remained behind and said to First People, "The gods wane to create people who look like them. Many of you have bodies like the gods, but you have the teeth, claws, and feet of insects and animals. Be clean and ready when we return to you in twelve days." <br><br>
            On the morning of the twelfth day, Black Body and Blue Body returned with two sacred buckskins. White Body returned carrying two perfect ears of corn, a white ear and a yellow ear. They placed the ears of corn on one of the buckskins, with the head of the buckskin facing west and the tips of the corn facing east. They placed an eagle's feather under each ear of corn, one from the white eagle under the white ear and one from the yellow eagle under the yellow ear. Then they covered both ears of corn with the second buckskin. <br><br>
            The White Wind entered from the east and the Yellow Wind from the west, and they blew on the ears of corn that lay between the two buckskins. When the gods lifted the upper buckskin, First People saw that the white ear of corn had become First Man and the yellow ear of corn had become First Woman. The winds had blown life into them just as they blow life into each of us. <br><br>
            For many years First People lived together peacefully in the Yellow World. Eventually, though, they increased in number until there was not enough food to feed them all. Those who were strong and fleet found food; those who were clever and stronger stole it. First People sent messengers to the four corners of the Yellow World to call all the people to assembly in order to choose one who would rule them all. <br><br>
            From the west came the Mountain People, who suggested that Mountain Lion should lead First People because he was both strong and wise. From the east came the Plains and Mesa Peoples, who suggested that Wolf should lead First People because he was both strong and clever. From the south came the Valley People, who suggested that Bluebird should lead First People because he was both wise and kind. From the north came the Forest People, who suggested that Hummingbird should lead First People because he was both swift and just. <br><br>
            When no group would accept the animal that another group suggested, Owl announced, "Let Lion return to his home in the west, Wolf to his home in the east, Bluebird to his home in the south, and Hummingbird to his home in the north. Let each of them bring back something that will help us. When we see what they can do for us, we can choose our leader." <br><br> 
            Everyone agreed, and the four animals set forth. When eight days and nights had come and gone, Wolf returned. He was dressed all in white, from the cloud on his head and the robe on his body to the stalk of white corn and the white gourd rain-rattle in his hands. "Far to the east," he said, "I found these gifts for you: springtime rain, the light of morning, and young corn." <br><br>
            Wolf had hardly finished speaking when Bluebird arrived. He was dressed all in blue, from the cloud on his head and the robe on his body to the stalk of blue corn and the blue turquoise rattle in his hands. "Far to the south," he said, "I found these gifts for you: summer rain, blue sky, and soft corn." <br><br>
            Then, from the west, Lion arrived. He was dressed all in yellow, from the cloud on his head and the robe on his body to the stalk of yellow corn and the jasper rattle in his hands. "Far to the west," he said, "I found these gifts for you: autumn rain, evening light, and ripe corn." <br><br>
            Finally Hummingbird arrived from the north. He was dressed in the bright colors of the northern lights, from the cloud on his head and the robe on his body to the stalk of multicolored corn and the abalone-shell bowl of colored beans in his hands. "Far to the north," he said, "I found these gifts for you: northern lights for winter nights, dried corn and beans for winter food, and an abalone storage bowl that will always be full." <br><br>
            First People realized that they needed the gifts of all four leaders. They decided to be ruled by a council of wise people rather than by a single chief. From that day until this, in order to remind the Navajo people of the gifts they brought them, Wolf wears a silvery white coat, Bluebird a blue-feathered coat, Lion a coat of yellow fur, and Hummingbird a coat of many colors. <br><br>
            But solving the question of leadership did not solve the problem of food. First People did not know the proper way to plant the seeds they had, and they did not think to pray and bless the seeds before they planted them. Consequently, it was not long before First People knew that the time had come when they must move to another world or starve. They all flew up to the roof of the Yellow World, but they could find no cracks in it. They flew around and around, becoming more and more tired, but still they could see no way to enter the Fourth World. <br><br>
            Suddenly four voices called to them from the next world—one from the east, one from the south, one from the west, and one from the north. Four faces, each wearing a blue mask, were looking down from the four edges of the roof. First People divided into four groups, and each flew toward a different face. Those who became the first Navajo flew to the east and let First Woman direct them into the next world. The Bird People flew to the south and let First Girl direct them toward the warm part of the next world, where they spent each winter thereafter. The Animal People flew to the west and let the First Man direct them toward the mountainous part of the next world, where they made their homes among the trees. The Insect People flew to the north and let First Boy direct them toward the cold part of the next world, where they immediately burrowed into the ground and waited for warmer weather.<br><br>
            To the surprise of First People, the Fourth World, or Black-and-White World, was already populated with other human beings. Their neighbors were the Hopi, Zuni, Acoma, and other Indians who lived in pueblos. They also met Comanche, Apache, and Ute nearby. First Man and First Woman taught their people how to live in the Fourth World, where the days were white and the nights were black. They added corn and beans to their diet of roots, seeds, nuts, and berries. "Learn from your neighbors who live in pueblos how to cultivate beans and corn," they advised. <br><br>
            First Man and First Woman had hardly finished talking when two dust columns blew upon them, one from the south and one from the north. The two columns met with a crash, deposited two bundles upon the land, rose into the air, and disappeared. <br><br>
            "Oh, dear!" First Man exclaimed. "The North Wind has given us Coyote, who thinks only of being lazy and playing tricks!" <br><br>
            "Do not worry!" First Woman responded. "The South Wind has brought us Badger, who has the industry and determination that Coyote lacks!" <br><br>
            One day Coyote went to the Pueblo People and challenged Water Monster to a game of chance. Since Coyote cheated, he won everything Water Monster had, even his fur coat. When Coyote returned home, he noticed Water Monster's two babies sleeping inside the pocket of their father's fur coat. "Oh, well! I will keep these along with the coat," he said. "And I will be very careful not to say one word about them." <br><br>
            When Water Monster found that Coyote had taken his babies along with his coat, his heart filled with rage. "I will destroy the land in the Fourth World and all the people who live on it!" he cried. He dived to the bottom of the sea and opened up all the dams that confined the waters beneath the earth. As these waters poured into the ocean, the sea rose and began to cover the dry land. As more and more water filled the ocean bed, more and more water washed upon the land in angry black waves. Higher and higher the waves stretched, until they formed a wall of water as tall as the highest mountains. <br><br>
            Turkey, who was a pet of First Man and First Woman, was the first to discover the invading flood. When people heard his story, they prepared to leave their homes and head for the high mountains to the west. The people were sad to leave their rich crops, but they had no choice. <br><br>
            Most of the Navajo, the Hopi, the Zuni, the Acoma, the Apache, the Ute, and the Plains Indians gathered a supply of food and necessary items and headed for the mountains. At the head of the procession was Coyote, who had Water Monster's children, along with many other possessions, in a great bag. By the time the last people reached the mountaintop, the land below them had completely disappeared under a great flood. Those who remained behind turned into water people, such as fish and seals. 
            Once the people had gathered on the mountain peak, one wise man from each of the thirty-two clans of the Navajo stood in a circle, and each of them planted a bamboo seed. For four days and nights the medicine men prayed for a quick, strong growth of bamboo. When the dawn of the fifth day arrived, the bamboo plants had joined together to form one huge, high, hollow, stalk-like tree. The people carved a door in the eastern side of the tree, and one by one went inside, using ladders they and Spider had made to climb higher and higher. <br><br>
            Turkey was the very last to reach the mountaintop. He had stopped to gather some of each kind of seed, which he buried in his feathers. White, blue, yellow, red, and multicolored corn, black and white beans, squash, melon, pumpkin, tobacco, and sunflower seeds were among them. As Turkey waddled up the trail, the black waters were angrily rushing upon him. Their foam brushed the tip of his tail as First Boy grabbed his head and pulled him inside the bamboo tree, and the marks of that foam remain on Turkey's tail feathers to this day. <br><br>
            Inside the tree, the people remained safe and dry. They showed First Woman the treasures they had brought from their homes in the Fourth World. Together they had collected everything they would need to begin life anew once the flood waters had receded. Only Turkey had remembered to bring the seeds of all the foods they ate, although these were the most important of all. The people honored Turkey for his good sense, and they honor him still. <br><br>
            As the black waters continued to swirl angrily around the great bamboo tree, rising higher and higher, the people climbed higher and higher inside the reed. Locust was the first to leave the bamboo stalk. He made a hole in the sky and won the island he found in the Fifth World for the peoples of the Fourth World. One by one the small animals entered the upper world, each using the treasures he or she had brought to make that world a better place. Badger, with a little help from Coyote, enlarged the tunnel so the creatures who were larger in size could also climb into the upper world. <br><br>
            So it came to pass that the last of the peoples of the Fourth World traveled up the tunnel into the Fifth World. The large animals were followed by the Hopi, the Zuni, and the other Pueblo people. The Apaches and the Plains Indians followed them. Finally the thirty-two Navajo clans emerged from the tunnel. First Woman was the last to leave. She brought Spider's ladder and the sacred eagle feathers. "From this time forth," she announced to her people, "we women will wear eagle feathers on our sacred headdresses, and we shall do the weaving for our people.” <br><br>
            Even in the new land, the flood was still a threat. The angry waters continued to rise, and a lake began to form at the top of the tunnel. "Water Monster must be angry with us for some reason. Only he could create a flood as great as this!" First Woman exclaimed. "We had better find out what is wrong, or we shall all drown!" <br><br>
            "I am certain Coyote is to blame for our problem," First Man said. "Everywhere he goes, he wears a fur coat that is not even his. Let us search his possessions." <br><br>
            First Woman and First Man discovered Water Monster's babies in the fur coat Coyote had won."Look here!" First Woman exclaimed. "Coyote has Water Monster's two babies. No wonder Water Monster is punishing us with a great flood! We must return his children to him at once!" <br><br>
            First Man and First Woman placed Water Monster's coat, with his babies in the pocket, into a boat and sent the boat out into the lake. When the boat came near a large blue bubble floating in the middle of the lake, the bubble suddenly burst and the boat, coat, and babies disappeared. Water Monster never troubled the people again. <br><br>
